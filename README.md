# EUinequality-MDscaling :mag_right:

The aim of this project is to explore inequality across EU countries with metric and non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS). Six inequality indicators from year 2018 were retrieved from Eurostat for each EU member state and summarised with dimensionality reduction techniques to compare which countries are more similar.

Then a small application of canonical correlation analysis performed over a different dataset (but still comparing EU countries) is presented to investigate the associations between different types of protein consumption and the percentage of workforce by industry.
